            <li>Summary:
                <p>Hi , I am Abdul Rahman and as of 2024 I am doing my Engineering II nd year . I am currently working on learning new skills. As of now I am working on 2 things , one is DSA using C++ and Web Development . <br/> <br/>I don't know what its going to be by the year 2027 (that's my graduation year) but what ever ,I just want to give my best. I want use the stuff I learn . For example , I have this subject named "Computer Organization and Arcitechture(COA)" I don't wanna learn COA just to pass my exams , But I want to do something innovative , remarkable in it (or) may be use this in my code to make more efficient.<br/> <br />I want to do something remarkable in tech industry , want to do something out of the box. If god wills , I will do something remarkable surely.<br/><br/>
                    Here are the quotes that motivates me to never stop : 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Future you will thank you for not giving up</li>
                        <li>Are my excuses more important that my dreams ?</li>
                        <li>You are crazy until you are successful</li>
                        <li>a time for everything , everything with in time</li>
                        <li>Fool for people or Fool for life ?</li>
                    </ul> <br/>
                My Goal is never to get high paid job or become a entrepreneur , no , never , like I have said , I just have one goal , achive something remarkable in tech industry. Not gonna lie back in the day my dream was to work with Apple . Even if i make a something remarkable in a company , thats completely fine . I wanna be someone who inspires other tech enthusiast. I might be delusional but surely one day I will stand on my words...
